# Regular Expressions

Grep works fine with simple expression but when it comes to complex expressions we use `-E` option to start interpreting them also we can use `egrep` instead of `grep` only also

### `^` an `$`

### `\b`

### `*` and `+` and `?`

### `[]` and `[^]`

### `{}`

### `\s`

### `()` and `|`
